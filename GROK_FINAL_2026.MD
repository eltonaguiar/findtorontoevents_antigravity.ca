**Generated by:** Grok (xAI)  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Version:** 1.0 - Full audit of stocks, penny stocks, mutual funds, crypto, meme coins, forex, sports betting systems. Includes algorithm rankings, enhancement plan with implemented quick wins, and phased todos.

---

## 1. FULL SUITE REVIEW
Based on analysis of local codebase (E:\findtorontoevents_antigravity.ca), remote site (https://findtorontoevents.ca), stocks DB (ejaguiar1_stocks), and betting DB (ejaguiar1_sportsbet). Reviewed via semantic search, performance probe PHP (deployed to /live-monitor/api/performance_probe.php), and direct file/code inspection.

### Stocks
- **Pages/Tools:** Consolidated Picks (consensus from 55+ algos), Top Picks, Horizon Picks, Portfolio Dashboard, Dividends/Earnings, Algorithm Leaderboard, Stock Intelligence, DayTrader Simulator.
- **Algorithms:** 136 total in `algorithms` table (e.g., CAN SLIM, Technical Momentum, Alpha Factor Composite). 19 active in live_signals.php (e.g., RSI Reversal, MACD Crossover, Alpha Predator).
- **Performance:** From algo_performance: Top - Sector Rotation (7.27% WR, -4.52% avg ret), Technical Momentum (25% WR, -4.64% avg ret). Overall poor (many 0% WR). lm_algo_performance shows Consensus FOREX at -37.62 Sharpe.
- **Strengths:** Regime gating, self-learning params, CDR focus.
- **Weaknesses:** Low WR (3-25%), negative returns, no advanced ML.

### Penny Stocks
- **Pages/Tools:** Penny Stock Finder (high-volume screener, RRSP-eligible).
- **Algorithms:** 7-factor scoring (financial health 30%, momentum 25%, etc.) in penny_stock_picks.py. Filters OTC, uses Altman Z/Piotroski.
- **Performance:** No dedicated perf table; inferred from goldmine tracker - moderate volume/liquidity focus.
- **Strengths:** Safety filters (Z-Score >1.5), volatility-adjusted targets.
- **Weaknesses:** Limited to $1-5, no live tracking.

### Mutual Funds
- **Pages/Tools:** Portfolio v2, Fund Stats, Fund Report.
- **Algorithms:** 10 in mf2_algorithms (e.g., MF Momentum, MF Value Tilt, MF Sector Rotation).
- **Performance:** From mf2_algo_performance: All 0% WR, 0% ret (e.g., MF Balanced Composite).
- **Strengths:** Cost optimization, risk parity.
- **Weaknesses:** No profitable params, stale data.

### Crypto
- **Pages/Tools:** Crypto Pairs Scanner, Crypto Portfolio, Meme Coin Scanner.
- **Algorithms:** 8 in cr_algorithms (e.g., CR Momentum, CR Breakout). 7-factor meme scoring.
- **Performance:** From cr_algo_performance: CR Breakout (0% WR, -5.99% ret), CR DCA (0%, -5.99%).
- **Strengths:** Self-resolving outcomes, BTC correlation filtering.
- **Weaknesses:** All 0% WR in learning scans, high volatility.

### Meme Coins
- **Pages/Tools:** Meme Coin Scanner (tiered discovery, sentiment potential).
- **Algorithms:** 7 meme-tuned factors (explosive vol, parabolic mom, social proxy).
- **Performance:** Inferred from goldmine - short-term momentum plays, no explicit perf table.
- **Strengths:** Dynamic discovery from 600+ pairs, 2h resolve.
- **Weaknesses:** High risk, no sentiment integration yet.

### Forex
- **Pages/Tools:** Forex Scanner, Forex Portfolio, Forex Stats.
- **Algorithms:** 8 in fx_algorithms (e.g., FX Trend Following, FX Carry Trade).
- **Performance:** From fx_algo_performance: FX Breakout (50% WR, -0.03% ret, -9.2 pips avg).
- **Strengths:** Regime mapping (USD strong = bear for EURUSD), session analysis.
- **Weaknesses:** Low returns, limited pairs (8).

### Sports Betting
- **Pages/Tools:** Sports Bet Finder, paper trading tracker.
- **Algorithms:** Value bet detection (EV >2%), odds comparison across 6 books.
- **Performance:** From betting DB - +25.34% ROI, 3 bets (2W/1L). Strongest suite.
- **Strengths:** Kelly sizing, auto-settlement, by-sport breakdowns.
- **Weaknesses:** Small sample, no ML models yet.

**Overall Suite Strengths:** Multi-asset unification (goldmine_tracker), automation (GitHub Actions), self-learning.
**Weaknesses:** Poor perf (0-25% WR, negative rets), API reliance, no unified backtester.

## 2. ALGORITHM RANKINGS
Ranked by composite score: (win_rate * 0.6) + (avg_return_pct * 0.4), from performance_probe.php data. Top 10 across all:

1. FX Breakout (Forex) - 50% WR, -0.03% ret (comp 29.88)
2. Momentum Continuation (Stocks) - 50% WR, -1.24% ret (comp 29.50)
3. Sector Rotation (Stocks) - 7.27% WR, -4.52% ret (comp 2.56)
4. Technical Momentum (Stocks) - 25% WR, -4.64% ret (comp 13.14)
5. Alpha Factor Composite (Stocks) - 0% WR, -3.23% ret (comp -1.29)
6. Alpha Factor Growth (Stocks) - 0% WR, -3.57% ret (comp -1.43)
7. Alpha Factor Earnings (Stocks) - 0% WR, -3.05% ret (comp -1.22)
8. Alpha Factor Quality (Stocks) - 0% WR, -3.24% ret (comp -1.30)

10. Alpha Factor Momentum (Stocks) - 0% WR, -3.07% ret (comp -1.23)

Sports betting leads (implied ~66% WR from small sample). Stocks/crypto/forex/mutual all low/negative. No meme/penny explicit rankings.

## 3. ENHANCEMENT PLAN
Goal: Maximize profits with scraping > APIs, GitHub Actions, no new costs. Implemented 8 quick wins (Phase 0-1 equivalents). Broke larger into 20 todos.

### Implemented Quick Wins (No Expense)
1. **Local Backtest Runner** - scripts/local_backtest.py: Tests strategies on historical data without API calls.
2. **Signal Archiver** - scripts/signal_archiver.py: Archives signals to CSV for offline analysis.
3. **Performance Analyzer** - scripts/perf_analyzer.py: Ranks algos from DB dumps, no live connection.
