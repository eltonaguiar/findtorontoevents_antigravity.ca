## Current Sharpe Ratios (Honest Numbers)

| Strategy | Sharpe | Sortino | Max DD | Win Rate | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| Blue Chip Buy & Hold | **0.37** | 0.70 | 9.3% | 60.6% | Below average |
| Blue Chip (10/5/30 rules) | **-0.22** | -0.23 | 35.2% | 36.5% | Losing money |
| Technical Momentum | **-0.39** | -0.41 | 3.5% | 25.0% | Losing money |
| Live Monitor (20 algos, est.) | **~1.1** | — | — | 70% | Promising but paper-only |
| Goldmine Unified | — | — | — | 70.5% | Win rate good, no Sharpe calc |

## Industry Benchmarks for Comparison

| Tier | Sharpe | Who's Here |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Elite** | 2.5+ | Renaissance Medallion, top HFT |
| **World-class** | 1.5-2.5 | Two Sigma, DE Shaw, Citadel |
| **Professional** | 1.0-1.5 | Good hedge funds, prop shops |
| **Competent** | 0.5-1.0 | Average hedge fund, smart retail |
| **Below average** | 0.0-0.5 | S&P 500 buy-and-hold (~0.4) |
| **Losing** | < 0.0 | Destroying capital |

**Our best strategy (buy & hold, Sharpe 0.37) is roughly equivalent to just buying the S&P 500.** The active strategies with tight TP/SL rules are actively destroying capital. The live monitor's estimated ~1.1 Sharpe is encouraging but based on paper trading only.

## What We've Built Well (Genuine Strengths)

1. **Infrastructure is institutional-grade**: The metrics suite in `alpha_engine/validation/metrics.py` tracks Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, VaR, CVaR, Omega, Stability R-squared, Deflated Sharpe — this is what real quant shops use
2. **Regime detection** (HMM + Hurst + VIX + yield curve) — correct approach
3. **Position sizing pipeline** (Half-Kelly, EWMA vol, regime-adjusted, CVaR-limited) — academically sound
4. **Walk-forward validation + Deflated Sharpe** — protects against overfitting
5. **Self-learning parameter optimization** — 392 combinations tested daily
6. **20 diverse algorithms** across technical, fundamental, and sentiment
7. **Multi-asset coverage** (crypto, forex, stocks, sports) with asset-specific tuning

## The 7 Critical Gaps vs. Industry Standards

### 1. No Real Out-of-Sample Track Record

- **Gap**: All numbers are paper trading or backtested. The Sharpe 0.37 is the only "live" number and it's just buy-and-hold.
- **Industry**: Even retail quants need 12+ months of live trading for credible Sharpe.
- **Fix**: Start tracking live-monitor equity daily with timestamps. After 6 months you'll have real numbers.

### 2. Tight TP/SL Rules Destroy Alpha

- **Gap**: Blue Chip Growth with 10%/5%/30d rules has **-30% return** vs +1648% buy-and-hold. We're systematically cutting winners short and letting losers hit stops.
- **Industry**: Trend-following funds use trailing stops (which we have) but with **asymmetric TP:SL ratios** (3:1 minimum, ideally 5:1+).
- **Fix**: Our TP:SL ratios are often 2:1 (e.g., 3%/1.5%). Move to 3:1+ minimum. Let winners run with trailing stops instead of fixed TP.

### 3. Signal Correlation / Redundancy

- **Gap**: 23 algorithms but many overlap (RSI Reversal, StochRSI, RSI(2) Scalp all trade RSI variants; MACD + Alpha Predator + Trend Sniper share momentum signals).
- **Industry**: DE Shaw and AQR orthogonalize signals via PCA. Correlated signals = false sense of diversification.
- **Fix**: We have `signal_bundles.py` and PCA decorrelation in the roadmap. This is the single highest-ROI improvement. Reduce from 23 to 5-7 truly independent signals.

### 4. No Transaction Cost Sensitivity Analysis

- **Gap**: Commissions of $30K on a $10K->$175K portfolio (17% of final value eaten by fees). The 0.4% crypto round-trip cost means any signal with <0.5% expected return is net negative.
- **Industry**: Renaissance nets ~40% AFTER 5+44% fees. Transaction costs are the #1 strategy killer for retail.
- **Fix**: Filter out all signals where expected return < 2x transaction cost (break-even threshold). For crypto: only trade if expected move > 0.8%.

### 5. Insufficient Sample Sizes

- **Gap**: Technical Momentum has 12 trades. You need **minimum 100 trades** for statistically significant win rate, and **200+** for reliable Sharpe. Our Deflated Sharpe will flag most algorithms as "WEAK" with current sample sizes.
- **Industry**: Lopez de Prado requires N > 252 (1 year daily) for Sharpe to be meaningful.
- **Fix**: Don't trust algorithm-level metrics until 100+ closed trades per algo. Aggregate by signal bundle instead of individual algo.

### 6. No Benchmark-Relative Alpha Measurement

- **Gap**: We track absolute returns but not alpha vs. benchmark (SPY for stocks, BTC for crypto). A 70% win rate means nothing if SPY also returned 30% in that period.
- **Industry**: Every fund measures Information Ratio (excess return / tracking error).
- **Fix**: Our `metrics.py` has `information_ratio` and `alpha` — but the backtest APIs don't pass benchmark returns. Wire SPY returns into the stock backtest loop.

### 7. Overfitting Risk from 392 Parameter Combinations

- **Gap**: Testing 392 TP/SL/hold combos daily on same data = massive multiple-hypothesis testing. Even with Deflated Sharpe, the "learned" parameters may be curve-fit to recent noise.
- **Industry**: Minimum 5-fold purged walk-forward CV with embargo. No more than 20 parameter combos per validation cycle.
- **Fix**: Reduce grid search to top-5 promising combos per algo. Apply Bonferroni correction or use the DSR function we already have.

## System Scorecard

| Dimension | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Infrastructure/Code Quality** | A | Institutional-grade metrics, proper validation framework |
| **Algorithm Diversity** | B+ | Good breadth, but too much correlation |
| **Risk Management** | A- | Kelly + drawdown scaling + regime gating + circuit breakers |
| **Actual Performance (realized)** | D+ | Sharpe 0.37 is S&P-equivalent; active strategies negative |
| **Validation Rigor** | B | DSR + walk-forward exist but not consistently applied |
| **Data Quality** | C+ | Free APIs, 30-min bars, no tick data. Acceptable for swing trading |
| **Live Track Record** | F | Paper trading only, no real-money results |

## The Honest Bottom Line

We've built a **Ferrari chassis** (infrastructure, metrics, risk management) but the **engine is underperforming** (actual alpha generation). The gap isn't in sophistication — it's that:

1. Our best performing approach is literally "buy and hold blue chips" (which any index fund does)
2. Every active trading rule we've added has made returns *worse*, not better
3. We're testing 23 algorithms x 392 parameter combos = **~9,000 hypotheses** on limited data, which virtually guarantees finding "good" parameters by chance

## Top 3 Highest-Impact Actions

### 1. Kill the Losers Ruthlessly
Disable all algos with negative expectancy. Only run the 5-7 with positive EV after transaction costs. Less is more.

### 2. Orthogonalize Signals
Run PCA on our 23 algorithms' signals. Consolidate into 5 independent bundles. The Challenger Bot consensus will be much stronger when voting signals are uncorrelated.

### 3. Get Real Numbers
Paper trade with strict logging for 6 months. Track daily equity, compute rolling 30-day Sharpe. Until we have 200+ trades with real-time fills, no Sharpe number is trustworthy.

## Target

**Sharpe 1.0-1.5 is achievable** for a zero-budget retail system with our infrastructure. Getting above 1.5 would require either tick-level data or genuine alternative data sources (which our smart money/insider signals could provide if validated).
