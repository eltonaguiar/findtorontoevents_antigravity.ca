## Recommendations
- tighten_risk_and_reduce_gross_exposure: Choppy regime or drawdown breach warrants smaller sizing and tighter review cadence.
- refresh_local_monitors: Data freshness or pricing gaps need a local refresh cycle before acting on signals. (`refresh_kpis`)
- route_cta_commodity_momentum_term_to_mutation_or_inverse: cta_commodity_momentum_term is under threshold. Follow the repo policy: mutate or invert instead of disabling. (`alpha_mutation_scan`)
- route_ml_enhanced_TRXUSDT_1d_B_lightgbm_to_mutation_or_inverse: ml_enhanced_TRXUSDT_1d_B_lightgbm is under threshold. Follow the repo policy: mutate or invert instead of disabling. (`alpha_mutation_scan`)
- route_fx_smart_carry_trade_momentum_to_mutation_or_inverse: fx_smart_carry_trade_momentum is under threshold. Follow the repo policy: mutate or invert instead of disabling. (`alpha_mutation_scan`)
- review_symbol_level_peer_conflicts: Conflicting peer directions can indicate regime disagreement or stale assumptions. (`refresh_portfolio_monitor`)
- prefer_validated_leaders_for_next_cycle: Current leaders are ml_enhanced_BNBUSDT_15m_B_lightgbm, clone_hl_copy_PensionFund_24M, luxalgo_confluence. Bias new risk toward proven survivors.
