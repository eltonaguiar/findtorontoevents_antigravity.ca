## What is "Creator Health"?
The **Creator Health** score is a composite metric shown for each creator. It is calculated based on:
- **Total followers** across all linked accounts (higher followers = higher score, up to a cap)
- **Live status** (currently live creators get a bonus)
- **Pinned/Favorite** status (pinned or favorite creators get a bonus)

The score ranges from 10 to 100 and is intended to give a quick sense of a creator's current popularity and engagement. It is not a medical or well-being metric.
