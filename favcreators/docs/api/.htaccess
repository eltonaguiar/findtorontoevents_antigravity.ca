# Allow PHP execution

# Google OAuth Configuration
# Set these via your hosting control panel instead of here for security
# Or use php_value if your host supports it:
# php_value GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID your_client_id_here
# php_value GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET your_client_secret_here

# CORS Headers — handled per-file in each PHP script.
# DO NOT set blanket CORS here: it duplicates with PHP header() calls,
# producing "*, *" which browsers reject. Also conflicts with
# get_me.php which uses credentials:'include' (wildcard * not allowed).
# See: track.php, guest_usage.php, etc. — each sets its own CORS.
