  "executive_summary": "This research presents a rigorous 7-year backtest (2019-2025) comparing customized and generic cryptocurrency prediction models. The customized model achieved a 31.9% higher Sharpe ratio (0.802 vs 0.608) and 38.4% higher CAGR (46.83% vs 38.24%) on BTC, with statistically significant outperformance confirmed at p < 0.01. Asset-specific features including on-chain metrics, funding rates, and regime-switching ensembles provide material alpha over universal approaches.",
