# Unified Predictions Dashboard - Comprehensive Implementation Plan
## Executive Summary

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Focus:** Consolidating high-performing systems (Cursor Genius, Sector Rotation, Sports Betting) into unified architecture

---

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

Based on analysis of the ANTIGRAVITYMOTHERLOAD.MD findings, we've identified critical performance discrepancies and hidden gems in your trading platform. The unified dashboard will:

### Key Discoveries
- **Cursor Genius**: Hidden star performer with +1,324% return (65.3% WR)
- **Sector Rotation**: Contradicts backtest - actually +354% return (64% WR)  
- **Sports Betting**: Confirmed winner with +25.3% ROI
- **Critical Gap**: 70.5% signal quality vs 3.84% execution quality

### Primary Objectives
1. **Feature high-performers** prominently
2. **Consolidate** 33+ pages and 35+ APIs
3. **Address execution gap** (commission drag, win/loss ratio)
4. **Integrate GROK_XAI improvements** (HMM regime, Kelly sizing)
