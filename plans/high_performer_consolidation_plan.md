# High-Performer Consolidation Plan
## Optimizing Cursor Genius, Sector Rotation, and Sports Betting Systems

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Focus:** Performance optimization of proven winners, execution quality improvement

---

## Executive Summary

Based on the ANTIGRAVITYMOTHERLOAD analysis, we'll focus consolidation efforts on the **proven high-performers** while addressing the critical execution gap. The strategy prioritizes:

- **Cursor Genius**: +1,324% return, 65.3% win rate (308 picks) - Hidden star performer
- **Sector Rotation**: +354% return, 64% win rate (275 picks) - Contradicts backtest
- **Sports Betting**: +25.3% ROI confirmed - Only profitable real-money system

**Critical Issue**: 70.5% signal quality vs 3.84% backtest performance due to execution gap

## Performance-Focused Consolidation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Performer Integration (Week 1)

#### Dashboard Enhancement

```

#### High-Performer Pages to Consolidate
- `/findstocks/portfolio2/leaderboard.html` → `/predictions/leaderboard.html` (Cursor Genius, Sector Rotation)
- `/live-monitor/sports-betting.html` → `/predictions/sports.html`
- `/findstocks/portfolio2/dashboard.html` → `/predictions/dashboard.html` (enhanced)

#### Pages to Deprioritize (Keep Standalone)
- Crypto Scanner (0% WR, -2.25% avg) - Pause until fixed
- ETF Masters (3.37% WR, -$4,139 loss) - Pause
- Mean Reversion strategies - Regime-dependent

### Phase 2: Execution Quality Improvement (Week 2)

#### Critical Fixes Identified
1. **Commission Drag**: $8,340 on $10K capital (83.4% consumed)
2. **Win/Loss Ratio**: Avg win +0.72% vs avg loss -12.01% (1:16.7 ratio)
3. **Trade Timing**: 67% of trades expire without hitting targets

### Phase 3: GROK_XAI Integration (Week 3)

#### Performance Enhancements
1. **HMM Regime Detection** - Adaptive strategy selection
2. **Kelly Sizing Engine** - Position sizing based on signal strength
3. **Multi-Timeframe Momentum** - 5m/1h/4h/1d analysis
4. **Alternative Data Integration** - Funding rates, sentiment analysis
