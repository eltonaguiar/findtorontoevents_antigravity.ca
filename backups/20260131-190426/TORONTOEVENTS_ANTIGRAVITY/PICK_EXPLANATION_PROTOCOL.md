# Pick Explanation Protocol

This document outlines a standardized protocol for generating human-readable, value-added explanations for every stock pick generated by the STOCKSUNIFY engines. The goal is to translate complex algorithmic signals into clear, actionable insights for users with varying levels of financial expertise.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles

- **Clarity over Jargon**: Prioritize simple language. Explain *what an indicator means* for the stock, not just what the indicator is.
- **Persona-Driven Content**: Structure the explanation to answer the key questions of different user types (Beginner, Trader, Investor).
- **Actionable Information**: Every explanation must include a clear "Trade Plan" with entry, exit, and risk management parameters.
- **Honest Risk Assessment**: Clearly state the potential risks and what could make the trade fail. Never present a pick as a guaranteed winner.

## 2. The Standard Pick Explanation Template

This template should be used as the structure for generating a detailed explanation for each "Winning Pick" that is presented to a user.

### **[STRONG BUY] LRCX - Lam Research Corporation**
**Date:** 2026-01-28

---

### **Plain English Summary**
*(**Target Audience:** The Beginner Investor)*

> We've flagged Lam Research (LRCX) as a high-potential pick. It's a strong, well-established company that is currently showing exceptional momentum compared to its peers, meaning its price has been increasing smoothly and consistently. Our system sees this as a high-conviction opportunity for a medium-term hold. While this pick is based on strong performance, all stock trades carry risk, and this trade should be protected with the stop-loss price defined below.

### **The Trade Plan**
*(**Target Audience:** The Active Trader)*

- **Algorithm:** Volatility-Adjusted Momentum (V2)
- **Time Horizon:** **1 Month** (Swing Trade)
- **Position:** **Long**
- **Confidence:** **High** (Score: 100/100)
- ---
- **Entry Price (Simulated):** `$150.75` (Includes a simulated +0.5% for slippage)
- **Profit Target (Example):** `$165.00` (e.g., calculated via ATR or a fixed ~10% gain)
- **Stop Loss:** `$142.50` (e.g., calculated via `price - 2 * ATR`)

---

### **The Technical Thesis**
*(**Target Audience:** The Advanced User)*

This pick was triggered by the **Volatility-Adjusted Momentum (VAM)** algorithm. The goal of VAM is to find stocks with the "smoothest" upward trends, prioritizing consistent returns over volatile, erratic price spikes.

- **Key Metrics:**
    - **Martin Ratio:** `8.89` - This is extremely high and indicates an exceptional ratio of returns relative to the depth and duration of its drawdowns.
    - **Total Return (60-day):** `+48.10%` - Shows powerful recent performance, passing our minimum threshold.
    - **Ulcer Index:** `5.41` - Measures the "anxiety" of holding the stock. A low number is better, and this indicates the recent uptrend has been relatively stress-free.
    - **Year-to-Date (YTD) Return:** `+55.20%` - Confirms strong long-term momentum throughout the current year.

---

### **Long-Term Outlook**
*(**Target Audience:** The Long-Term Investor)*

While this specific trade is planned for one month, these metrics provide context on the company's broader health.

- **Market Cap:** `$50B+` (Large Cap) - Indicates a large, stable, and well-established company.
- **P/E Ratio:** `25` (if available) - A reasonable valuation for a growth-oriented tech company.
- **Trend Status:** The price is trading well above its 200-day moving average, confirming a strong, long-term uptrend is firmly in place.

---

### **Key Risks & Considerations**

- **High Momentum Risk:** This pick is based on strong recent performance. High-momentum stocks can be the first to sell off during a sudden market correction.
- **Market-Dependence:** The success of this trade assumes the overall market (e.g., the S&P 500) does not experience a significant downturn. A market-wide panic would likely invalidate this trade setup.

## 3. Implementation Guide

This protocol should be implemented in a new script, for example `scripts/generate-pick-explanations.ts`.

1.  The script should load the latest `daily-stocks.json` or `current.json`.
2.  For each pick in the file, it should generate a corresponding markdown file or JSON object using the template above.
3.  Indicator values (like Martin Ratio, YTD Return, etc.) should be pulled directly from the `metrics` or `indicators` object within each pick.
4.  Calculated fields like Profit Target and Stop Loss should be clearly defined. The `stopLoss` is already provided by most V1 scorers; a consistent `profitTarget` logic (e.g., `entry + 3 * ATR`) could be added.
5.  This generated content can then be:
    *   Synced to a documentation repository.
    *   Served via an API endpoint.
    *   Used to populate a "details" view on the frontend website.
