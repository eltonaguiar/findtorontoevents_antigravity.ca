# Plan: Phase 2 - Visualization & Validation

This plan outlines the next steps for the STOCKSUNIFY2 project, focusing on public validation of the scientific engine and ensuring robust automation.

## 1. Implement "Performance Truth" Dashboard

**Objective:** To publicly display the realized returns of the algorithmic picks, closing the feedback loop and demonstrating the system's "falsifiability."

**Key Actions:**
-   **Create Frontend Component:** Develop a new React component within the `TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY` project.
-   **Data Consumption:** This component will fetch and parse the `performance-report.json` generated by the `verify-performance.ts` script.
-   **Visualization:** Render a chart (e.g., using a library like Chart.js or D3) that clearly compares "Projected Returns" against "Realized Returns."
-   **Integration:** Embed this component into the `/findstocks2` page to provide a seamless user experience.

**File to Modify:** `src/app/findstocks2/FindStocksV2Client.tsx` (and new component files).

## 2. Verify "Genesis" Daily Automation

**Objective:** Confirm that the automated daily audit process in the `STOCKSUNIFY2` repository is functioning correctly.

**Key Actions:**
-   **Monitor GitHub Actions:** On January 28, 2026, check the "Actions" tab of the `eltonaguiar/stocksunify2` GitHub repository.
-   **Verify Execution:** Confirm the `daily-audit.yml` workflow completed successfully around 21:00 UTC.
-   **Check for Artifacts:** Ensure a new JSON ledger file was committed to the `data/v2/history/2026/01/` directory.

**Contingency Plan:** If the workflow fails, investigate the logs for errors (e.g., API key issues, rate limiting) and apply necessary fixes, such as optimizing `stock-data-fetcher-enhanced.ts`.

## 3. Integrate Weekly "Truth Engine" Data

**Objective:** Automate the display of the weekly performance verification on the main website.

**Key Actions:**
-   **Update Data Client:** Modify `FindStocksV2Client.tsx` in `TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY` to fetch and handle the `performance-report.json` file.
-   **Dynamic Rendering:** Replace the current static text in the "Truth Engine" section of the page with dynamic content rendered from the report.

## 4. Codebase Hygiene: Unify Data Fetchers

**Objective:** Eliminate redundant code and ensure all parts of the application use the most robust data fetching logic.

**Key Actions:**
-   **Analysis:** Review the `TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY` codebase to identify all calls to the legacy `stock-data-fetcher.ts`.
-   **Refactoring:** Replace these calls with the enhanced `stock-data-fetcher-enhanced.ts`.
-   **Deprecation:** Once all calls are migrated, delete the legacy `stock-data-fetcher.ts` file to prevent future use.
