"<h3>Manage Database Instructions</h3>
<p>On this page the following functions can be selected:</p>
<h6>Compact database</h6>
<p>When a user deletes an event, the event will be marked as 'deleted', but will 
not be removed from the database. The Compact Database function will permanently 
remove events deleted more than 30 days ago from the database and free the space 
occupied by these events.</p>
<h6>Backup database</h6>
<p>This function will create a backup of the full calendar database (tables 
structure and contents) in .sql format. The backup will be saved in the 
<strong>files/</strong> directory with file name: 
<kbd>dump-cal-lcv-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'cal' = calendar ID, lcv = 
calendar version and 'yyyymmdd-hhmmss' = year, month, day, hour, minutes and 
seconds).</p>
<p>The backup file can be used to recreate the calendar database (structure and 
data), via the restore function described below or by using for instance the 
<strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> tool, which is provided by most web hosts.</p>
<h6>Restore database</h6>
<p>This function will restore the calendar database with the contents of the 
uploaded backup file (file type .sql). If your .sql file is larger than 2MB you may have to modify the <b>upload_max_filesize</b> and <b>post_max_size</b> variables in the php.ini file, or split your .sql file in several smaller files. See the admin_guide.html section 3 for a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>When restoring the database, ALL CURRENTLY PRESENT DATA WILL BE LOST!</p>
<h6>Events</h6>
<p>This function will delete or undelete events which are occurring between the 
specified dates. If a date is left blank, there is no date limit; so if both 
dates are left blank, ALL EVENTS WILL BE DELETED!</p><br>
<p>IMPORTANT: When the database is compacted (see above), the events which are 
permanently removed from the database cannot be undeleted anymore!</p>",

<p>The selected event date format and event time format on the left must match the 
format of the dates and times in the uploaded CSV file.</p>
<p>If no start time (blank) is present, the event will be shown as a 'no time' event 
in the calendar. If the start time is 00:00 or 12:00am, the event will be shown as 
an 'all day' event in the calendar.</p>
<h6>Table of Categories</h6>
<p>The calendar uses ID numbers to specify categories. The category IDs in the CSV 
file should correspond to the categories used in your calendar or be blank.</p>
<p>If in the next step you want to earmark events as 'birthday', the <strong>Birthday 
category ID</strong> must be set to the corresponding ID in the category list below.</p>
