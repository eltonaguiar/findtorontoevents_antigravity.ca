### Strategy Toggle Settings (Auto-Adjusted)

| Strategy | Weight | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Momentum | 1.0 (Full) | Hurst confirms trending behavior |
| Mean Reversion | 0.2 (Reduced) | Sideways regime reduces reversion edge |
| Fundamental | 1.0 (Full) | Macro data reliable in current regime |
| Sentiment | 0.5 (Moderate) | Social signals noisy in sideways market |
| ML Alpha | 0.5 (Moderate) | Meta-labeler confidence moderate |

### Cross-Asset Regime Summary

| Asset Class | HMM Regime | Hurst | Probability |
|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Crypto (BTC) | Sideways | 1.0 (Strong trend) | 100% |
| Forex (EUR/USD) | Bear | 1.0 (Strong trend) | 100% |
| Stocks (SPY) | Sideways | 0.956 (Trending) | 100% |

### Cross-Asset Correlation Signals

| Signal | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Bond-to-Equity | 0.0 | Neutral (no divergence) |
| Gold-to-Crypto | 50.0 | Bearish for crypto (gold outperforming) |
| Oil-to-Equity | 0.0 | Neutral |

**Takeaway:** We are in a sideways-to-bearish environment with the dollar weakening and gold surging. The Hurst exponent shows trending behavior within the sideways range, meaning momentum strategies should work but with tighter stops. Forex is in a confirmed bear regime for USD pairs.

| Win Rate | 0% |
| Total P/L | -$3.45 |
| Average Return | -0.23% |
| Average Hold | 10.5 hours |

### Forex Analysis

**Why All 3 Forex Trades Lost:**
1. **Wrong direction on USD strength:** All 3 trades were LONG on USD crosses (long USDJPY = long USD, long EURUSD = short USD, long GBPUSD = short USD). Two of these (EURUSD, GBPUSD) were betting against the dollar, while USDJPY was betting with it — but USD was weakening.
2. **Max hold exits:** All 3 exited at max hold time, meaning they never hit their profit targets. The learned parameters shortened hold times (6-12h vs 12-24h original), which may have been too aggressive.
3. **Tight ranges:** Price ranges were very narrow during the hold period, suggesting low volatility execution windows.

**Forex Outlook:**
- DXY weakening trend supports EUR/USD and GBP/USD longs
- But the bear regime classification creates a conflict — the system may be slow to adapt
- JPY strengthening against USD as safe-haven demand increases
- Recommendation: The learned parameters may need recalibration for current volatility environment

- **Win Rate:** 33.3% (1 win, 2 losses)
- **ROI:** +25.34% (positive despite losing more bets than winning)
- **Why?** Quarter-Kelly sizing means large bets on high-probability picks and tiny bets on long shots. The $50 Spurs bet at 1.30 odds was a high-confidence play that paid off, while the two losses were sub-$2 speculative bets.
- **This is working as designed** — Kelly criterion optimizes for bankroll growth, not win rate.

### By Sport Breakdown

| Sport | Bets | Wins | Losses | P/L | ROI |
|-------|------|------|--------|-----|-----|
| NBA | 2 | 1 | 1 | +$13.72 | +26.8% |
| NCAAB | 1 | 0 | 1 | -$0.58 | -100% |

### Active Pending Bets (14 Total, $252.69 at risk)

| Sport | Count | Types | Odds Range |
|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| NCAAB | 6 | Moneyline (underdogs) | 5.1 - 31.0 |
| NBA | 1 | Moneyline | 10.0 (Wizards) |
| MLS | 7 | Spreads & Totals | Various |

### Sports Betting Assessment
- **System is profitable** (+$13.14 / +25.34% ROI) after 3 settled bets
- Kelly sizing is working correctly — large bets on favorites, small bets on underdogs
- MLS season bets (Feb 22-23) are the next major settlement batch
- The value_bet algorithm is the only active strategy
- **Risk:** $252.69 currently at risk (25.3% of bankroll) across 14 bets — within acceptable limits for quarter-Kelly

### Key Insight
The **paper trading system** (4 trades, 0 wins) is performing poorly, but the **goldmine signal tracking** (677 picks, 70.5% win rate) shows the signals themselves have value. The disconnect suggests the paper trading execution parameters (position sizing, hold times, entry timing) need optimization — the signal quality is strong but execution is weak.

## BACKTEST RESULTS — REALITY CHECK

### CRITICAL: Backtest Shows Catastrophic Performance

The following backtest data paints a very different picture from the goldmine signal tracking. While the signal tracker reports a 70.5% win rate, the actual backtested execution results are devastating.

### backtest_quick.json — Full Portfolio Backtest

**Parameters:**
- Strategy: Custom | Initial Capital: $10,000
- Take Profit: 5% | Stop Loss: 3% | Max Hold: 5 days
- Commission: $10/trade | Slippage: 0.5% | Position Size: 10% | Max Positions: 10

**Results:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Final Portfolio Value | **$317.94** | **-96.82% loss** |
| Total Trades | 417 | High frequency |
| Winning Trades | 16 | Extremely low |
| Losing Trades | 401 | Overwhelming |
| **Win Rate** | **3.84%** | **CATASTROPHIC** |
| Average Win | +0.72% | Far too small |
| Average Loss | -12.01% | Far too large (4:1 loss ratio) |
| Best Trade | +2.00% | Very modest |
| Worst Trade | -145.28% | Extreme outlier |
| Sharpe Ratio | -0.70 | Deeply negative |
| Sortino Ratio | -0.56 | Deeply negative |
| Profit Factor | 0.008 | Near zero |
| Max Drawdown | -96.82% | Near total wipeout |
| Max Consecutive Losses | **224** | Unprecedented losing streak |
| Max Consecutive Wins | 2 | Very rare wins |
| Avg Hold | 4.34 days | Short-term |
| Kelly Criterion | 0% | Suggests zero position size |
| VaR (95%) | -43.92% | Extreme tail risk |
| CVaR (95%) | -69.14% | Catastrophic tail risk |

**Commission Drag:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Total Commissions Paid | $8,340 |
| Commission Drag | **83.4% of initial capital** |
| Trades x $10 commission | 417 x $10 = $4,170 (one-way) |

**Exit Reasons:**
| Reason | Count | % of Trades |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Max Hold (timed out) | 280 | 67.1% |
| Stop Loss Hit | 115 | 27.6% |
| Take Profit Hit | 22 | 5.3% |

**67% of trades hit max hold** — the algorithms are not reaching their profit targets. Combined with 27.6% stop loss hits, only 5.3% of trades are successful.

**Monthly Returns (Every Single Month Negative):**
| Month | Return |
|-------|--------|
| Feb 2024 | -124.0% |
| Mar 2024 | -71.9% |
| Apr 2024 | -185.2% |
| May 2024 | -83.2% |
| Jun 2024 | -185.6% |
| Jul 2024 | -194.6% |
| *...23 months total* | *All negative* |
| Positive Months | **0 out of 23** |

### Algorithm Breakdown — All Algorithms Failed

| Algorithm | Trades | Wins | Losses | Win Rate | Avg Return | Total P/L |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| ETF Masters | 178 | 6 | 172 | 3.37% | -11.51% | -$4,139.88 |
| Sector Rotation | 137 | 3 | 134 | 2.19% | -12.19% | -$3,296.82 |
| Cursor Genius | 52 | 6 | 46 | 11.54% | -6.24% | -$1,097.92 |
| Sector Momentum | 30 | 0 | 30 | 0% | -12.23% | -$677.40 |
| Blue Chip Growth | 18 | 1 | 17 | 5.56% | -5.83% | -$429.51 |
| Technical Momentum | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0% | -145.28% | -$20.34 |
| Composite Rating | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0% | -145.28% | -$20.34 |

**Every single algorithm is deeply unprofitable.** Cursor Genius was the "best" at 11.54% win rate, but still lost -$1,097.92. ETF Masters and Sector Rotation together account for -$7,436.70 of losses.

### backtest-simulation.json — Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

Ran Jan 28, 2026. Tests each algorithm at different confidence thresholds:

**CAN SLIM:**
| Threshold | Trades | Win Rate | Avg Return | Sharpe |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| 40 | 12 | 41.7% | -0.58% | -0.003 |
| 50 | 9 | 33.3% | -28.8% | -0.139 |
| 60 | 7 | 28.6% | -21.1% | -0.105 |
| 70 | 2 | 50.0% | -5.8% | -0.033 |
| 80+ | 0 | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Alpha Predator:**
| Threshold | Trades | Win Rate | Avg Return | Sharpe |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| 40 | 26 | 46.2% | -29.2% | -0.101 |
| 50 | 19 | 36.8% | -75.5% | -0.253 |
| 60 | 13 | 38.5% | -20.1% | -0.103 |
| 70 | 12 | 33.3% | -38.4% | -0.199 |
| 80+ | 1 | 0% | -180.0% | 0 |

**Composite Rating:**
| Threshold | Trades | Win Rate | Avg Return | Sharpe |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| 40 | 17 | 35.3% | -88.2% | -0.286 |
| 50 | 14 | 35.7% | -43.7% | -0.275 |
| 60 | 5 | 40.0% | -25.4% | -0.138 |
| **70** | **2** | **100%** | **+170.9%** | **72.4** |
| 80+ | 0 | N/A | N/A | N/A |

*Note: The Composite Rating threshold-70 result (100% win rate, 2 trades) is statistically insignificant — 2 trades cannot validate a strategy.*

**All algorithms show negative Sharpe ratios at every practical threshold.** Higher thresholds reduce trade count without improving returns, except for the statistically insignificant 2-trade edge case.

### edge_history90.json — Edge Dashboard

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Days Analyzed | 90 |
| Total Picks | **0** |
| Winners | 0 |
| Losers | 0 |

**The Edge system has generated zero picks in the last 90 days.** This system is effectively dormant.

### The Disconnect: Signal Tracking vs Execution

| System | Win Rate | Data Type | Assessment |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Goldmine Signal Tracker | 70.5% | Mark-to-market tracking | Tracks if price ever hits target |
| Paper Trading (Live) | 0% (4 trades) | Actual execution | Real entry/exit timing |
| Backtest (Historical) | 3.84% (417 trades) | Historical simulation | With commission + slippage |
| Edge History (90d) | N/A (0 picks) | Live picks | System dormant |

**Why the massive gap?**
1. **Commission drag destroys profits:** $8,340 in commissions on $10K capital. The 0.72% average win cannot overcome $10-$20 per trade costs.
2. **Asymmetric risk/reward:** Average loss (-12.01%) is 16.7x larger than average win (+0.72%). The stop loss at 3% is not actually limiting losses.
3. **Max hold exits dominate (67%):** Most trades expire without hitting targets, then absorb commissions on both sides.
4. **The worst trade (-145.28%)** suggests a position sizing or leverage error that wiped out more than the position value.
5. **Slippage at 0.5%** on top of $10 commission means each round-trip costs ~$20 + 1% slippage, which is devastating for small target returns.

## RISK ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Risk Profile

| Risk Factor | Level | Detail |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Market Risk | MODERATE | Sideways regime, elevated VIX (18.12) |
| Concentration Risk | LOW | Diversified across 6 asset classes |
| **Execution Risk** | **CRITICAL** | Backtest: 3.84% win rate, -96.82% drawdown |
| Liquidity Risk | LOW | Major assets only, no illiquid positions |
| **Model Risk** | **CRITICAL** | All 7 backtested algos failed; 2 of 3 live algos "DECAYED" |
| **Commission Risk** | **CRITICAL** | $8,340 commission drag on $10K capital (83.4%) |
| Currency Risk | MODERATE | DXY weakening, exposure to USD-denominated assets |

### Priority 1 — Fix What's Broken (Critical)

1. **Eliminate Commission Drag:** The $10/trade commission destroyed the portfolio. At 417 trades, commissions alone consumed 83.4% of capital. Solutions:
   - Switch to a zero-commission broker (Wealthsimple Trade for CDN, Interactive Brokers for US)
   - Reduce trade frequency drastically (from 417 trades/23 months to max 50)
   - Increase target profit per trade from 5% to 15-20% to make each trade worth the friction

2. **Fix the Win/Loss Ratio:** Average win (+0.72%) vs average loss (-12.01%) is a 1:16.7 ratio. The 3% stop loss is not functioning. Investigate why losses average -12% when the stop is set at -3%. Likely causes:
   - Slippage blowing through stops
   - Gaps in overnight/weekend trading
   - Stop loss not being executed properly in the simulation
   - Position sizing errors (the -145% worst trade should be impossible with proper sizing)

3. **Pause All Stock Algorithms:** ETF Masters (3.37% win rate), Sector Rotation (2.19%), Sector Momentum (0%) — these are worse than random. Pause them immediately and do not trade with them until fundamentally redesigned.

### Priority 2 — Build on What Works

4. **Sports Betting is the Only Profitable System:** +25.34% ROI, profitable Kelly sizing. Continue and potentially increase the bankroll allocation. This system works because value betting with Kelly criterion is mathematically sound and not subject to commission drag.

5. **Horizon Picks Show Promise:** Backtested 66-75% win rates across 3 horizons. Long-term growth picks are all green. This buy-and-hold approach avoids the high-frequency commission trap. Recommend increasing focus on longer-hold strategies.

6. **Crypto Signal Tracking Has Edge (70.5% win rate):** The goldmine tracker shows crypto signals generate alpha, but the paper trading execution fails to capture it. The issue is execution parameters, not signal quality. Consider:
   - Removing commissions from crypto (most exchanges are low/zero fee)
   - Wider take-profit targets to improve payoff ratio
   - Focus on the top-performing algorithms only (Momentum Burst, Alpha Predator, StochRSI)

### Priority 3 — Tactical Opportunities

7. **Exploit the Gold Rally:** Gold +9.67% in 20 days. Mining penny stocks surging (MSC.V +33%, DAU.V +19%, SVRS.V +12%). Consider adding GLD or gold miner signals.

8. **ETH is the Weakest Asset:** Alpha composite -4.390, recent stop-loss hits. Avoid long ETH positions.

9. **Meme Coin System is Too New:** 6 open positions, 0 closed. Cannot evaluate. Let current positions close before scaling up.

10. **Forex Needs Regime Alignment:** The system called EUR/USD bear but went long — contradictory. Fix the regime gate to prevent counter-trend entries.

### Overall Assessment

**The platform has built impressive infrastructure** — 20 algorithms, 8 tracking systems, 15+ automated pipelines, multi-asset coverage across stocks, crypto, forex, meme coins, penny stocks, and sports betting. The engineering is sophisticated.

**However, the backtest data reveals a critical truth: the stock trading algorithms do not work.** A 3.84% win rate across 417 trades resulting in a -96.82% portfolio loss is not a system that needs tuning — it needs fundamental redesign. The commission structure alone ($8,340 on $10K) makes profitability mathematically impossible at current trade frequencies.

**What IS working:**
- Sports betting (+$13.14, +25.34% ROI) — Kelly criterion is sound
- Goldmine crypto signal tracking (70.5% win rate, +368.92% cumulative) — signals have value
- Horizon stock picks (66-75% backtested win rate) — longer holds avoid commission trap
- Smart money consensus intelligence — strong data infrastructure for stock research

**What needs to be rebuilt:**
- All 7 backtested stock algorithms (ETF Masters, Sector Rotation, Cursor Genius, Sector Momentum, Blue Chip Growth, Technical Momentum, Composite Rating)
- The commission/fee structure
- The win/loss asymmetry (average loss 16.7x larger than average win)
- Paper trading execution parameters

**Bottom line:** The data and signal infrastructure is valuable. The trading execution layer needs a complete overhaul focused on reducing costs, fewer higher-quality trades, and proper risk management that actually limits losses to the stated stop-loss levels.
