Progress log (WSL)

- Ran `npm install` in `/mnt/c/Users/zerou/Documents/TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY`: up to date; 2 vulnerabilities reported (1 moderate, 1 high) with suggestion to run `npm audit` / `npm audit fix --force`.
- Ran `npm run stocks:v2:full` successfully (after an initial timeout at 10s). Output highlights:
  - Generated 81 picks.
  - Ledger written: `data/v2/history/2026/01/28.json`.
  - Live current written: `public/data/v2/current.json`.
  - Sync to `C:\Users\zerou\Documents\STOCKSUNIFY2` completed, commit `023f877` pushed to `https://github.com/eltonaguiar/stocksunify2.git`.
  - API failures reported for tickers: NAKD, HSTO, MULN.
  - Git warnings about LF -> CRLF conversion on several files.
- `npm run test` was started but interrupted by user; no results captured.

Next steps pending:
- Rerun `npm run test` (or `npm run lint`) if you want validation output captured.
- Review `data/daily-stocks.json` or ledger archive for earnings filter compliance (not checked yet).

Update

- Ran `npm run test`: PASS (3 files, 23 tests).
- Checked `data/daily-stocks.json` and `data/v2/history/2026/01/28.json`: no earnings-related fields present.
- Searched `data/` and `public/data/` for earnings-related keys (earnings/earningsDate/earningsCountdown/nextEarnings): no matches found.

Notes
- Because earnings metadata isn't present in these JSON outputs, I couldn't verify filter compliance directly from `daily-stocks.json` or the V2 ledger.
